TODO
- Player loses life when hit by enemy projectiles (X)
- Enemy projectile will change to a flame sprite when it collides with obstacle
  - Each enemy projectile needs a timer
  - When it collides with an obstacle:
      - Projectile.destroyed = True, which stops it from moving in the Update() method, because it only moves if projectile.destroyed = False
      - start the timer, change the sprite to flame
  - In Update method, check if the desired time has elapsed and then call self.kill()
- Score feature (Top of Screen)
- Lives feature (Top of Screen) (X)
- UFO feature (Flies by every 20 or so seconds (and at beginning before round starts))
