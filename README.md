# Space Invaders Redux

A recreation of Space Invaders using Pygame. All graphical assets made by me in Photoshop. This is my first ever game created in Python using Pygame. I tweaked some things from the original Space Invaders and added some features that I thought might be fun.

## Features
- A Menu system: Main Menu, Options, Main Game

- A bullet recharge bar, because I wanted to have a visual representation of the bullet recharge (something similar to the stamina bars in Dark Souls and Bloodborne). 

- At random intervals throughout the game, a UFO sprite will fly across the screen and increase the enemy_shoot_speed and enemy_speed on the x-axis
